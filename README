haserl (Html And Shell Embedded Runtime Language) is a cgi
program that runs interpreted scripts.   It combines three
elements into a single CGI interpreter:

1. It parses POST and GET requests, placing form-elements as name=value
pairs into the environment for the CGI script to use. It is similar
to uncgi (http://www.midwinter.com/~koreth/uncgi.html) in this respect

2. It opens a shell

3. It is very small, and so can be used in embedded environments
