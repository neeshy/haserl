haserl (HTML and Shell Embedded Runtime Language) is a CGI program that runs a
Lua script. It combines three elements into a single CGI interpreter:

1. It parses POST and GET requests, placing form-elements as name=value pairs
into the Lua environment for the CGI script to use. It is similar to uncgi
(http://www.midwinter.com/~koreth/uncgi.html) in this respect.
2. It runs a Lua script.
3. It is very small, so it can be used in embedded environments.
