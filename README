haserl (HTML and Shell Embedded Runtime Language) is a CGI program that runs a
Lua script. Here is short overview of its operation:

* If run as root, it drops its privileges by setting its uid/gid to the
  owner/group of the script.
* It parses POST and GET requests, placing form-elements as name=value pairs
  into the Lua environment for the CGI script to use.
* It executes a Lua script.
